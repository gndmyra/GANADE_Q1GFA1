        I am Myra Elaiza N. Ganade, called Myra or My by most people, and I am currently 14 years old. My MBTI is ISTP and I am a Sagittarius. I like to dance and I am a member of the Oasioas Dance Troupe. I also like to read books, listen to music, and take photos of random things. I love art in general. I love people who have a great sense of humor while still knowing their boundaries, and my biggest pet peeve is disrespectfulness.
